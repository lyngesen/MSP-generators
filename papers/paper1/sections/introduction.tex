\section{Introduction}

In several decomposition approaches for multi-objective optimization problems the \emph{Minkowski sum} of outcome vectors from subproblems are filtered for dominance. If the decomposition is effective, it will in many cases lead to several subproblems with a large number of non-dominated outcomes, and therefore the computation of the non-dominated set of the Minkowski sum may be computationanally demanding.
