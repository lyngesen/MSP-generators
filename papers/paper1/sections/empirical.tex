\section{Emperical study}
***RQ? Formulate major research questions.

Consider sweep methods. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
Generate a new point from a subproblem and update all generator sets and upper bound sets.
	\item 
Periodically generate a point for each subproblem whereafter all generator sets and upper bound sets are updated.
	\item 
Sweep: generate all supported non-dominated points for each subproblem whereafter all generator sets and upper bound sets are updated.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Emperical study of Generator sets}
When are generator sets small relative to the non-dominated sets.

\subsection{Emperical study of Generator upper bound sets}
When are upper bound sets from generators 'good'. (make precise).
