%% Text of abstract
Some multi-objective optimization problems can be solved using decomposition methods where a set of smaller independent subproblems are solved. For this class of problems, the global objectives can be described as the sum of local objective values of the subproblems. We present some theoretical results for the nondominated sets of such problems and formulate so-called generator sets. The generator sets consists only of the necessarily nondominated points for each subproblem required for generating the global nondominated set. 
%Using the generator sets we define improved upper bound sets for the subproblems which only remove nondominated points which only contribute to global dominated solutions.
Using the generator sets we define improved upper bound sets that reduce the search area for nondominated (generator) points in the subproblems.
Using these generator upper bound sets we present a method of solving the otherwise independent subproblems in a way which solve the global problem by sharing information between subproblems.
