representing interacting subsystems of the overall system. Since the calculation of ef-

overall system into component multiobjective programs, that are more easily solved
and then construct the efficient set of the overall system. For some classes of complex
systems, algebraic properties of set operations and relations are developed between
the efficient set of the overall system and the efficient sets of subproblems. The prop-
erties indicate that multiple decomposition and coordination schemes, with varying
assumptions regarding the system, may be applied to the same initial system.},
